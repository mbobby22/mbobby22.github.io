Does the code follow `SOLID` principles, `Domain Driven Design` and/or other `design paradigms` the team favours?

Can I understand what the code does by reading it?

If there are automated tests to ensure correctness of the code, do the tests really test that the code meets the agreed requirements?

Following are the key points to follow:

    Business functionality
    Framework-related coding guidelines: ZEND
    Object-oriented principles:    SOLID    DRY    YAGNI    Law of Demeter
    PHP-specific standards
    Programming-related best practices
    Design patterns
    Code coverage
    Security
    Exception-handling
    Integration patterns
