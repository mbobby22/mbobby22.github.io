<i>Digging more, based on this previous article [here][blog-link], I found some meaningful insights on this new field, born from wide adoption of minitoring and logging tools.</i>

Chaos Engineering brings in a massive paradigm shift with the design focus shifting to reliability as the key quotient, in comparison to systems that merely perform routine tasks.

Chaos Engineering increases reliability and uptime by surgically attacking the infrastructure to detect weak spots, thereby increasing resilience to service degradation. 

This is a notch higher than the conventional approach of typical Incident Response – Prevention lifecycle. <b>Experiments are run, data is collected, and fixes are made. Instead of hoping that disaster recovery and failover work as expected, Chaos Engineering actively tests assumptions, clarifying what works and what does not, during outages.</b>
