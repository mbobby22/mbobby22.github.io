<h4>Management style</h4>

Servant leader: inside each team, you have different levels of skills and different levels of motivation. You need to address each member in their own language.

<h4>Defining success</h4>

**As a person** I wake up in the morning and define a goal, one single goal I want to complete that day. If I achieve it at the end of the day, I will consider myself successful.

**As team lead** I measure success by having a motivated team. If they want to be there, if they are proactive, my work is done. I also feel accomplished if I help at least one single member.

<h4>Stress within team</h4>

I try to notice negativity during calls or debates and I talk privately to particular team member involved.

If there is a *personal issues*, I try to help as a person. If there is a *technical issue*, I help the member break it down and offer a different perspective.

Tolerating inappropiate behaviour impacts whole team and affects overall setup.

<h4>Conflicting code reviews</h4>

When conducting code review, I try to be neutral. I talk `1:1` to each party involved and give them the chance to present their own version.

If the issue requires higher qualification or competency, I do not hesitate to involve the unit's architect or principal engineer to help break down and decide on the solution to adopt.

<h4>Letting go an employee</h4>

Giving bad news is never easy, no matter the situation. I always try to be honest, authentic and empathic.

I have been involved a couple of times in this process myself, on both sides and this gives me an objective overview as manager and as team member.

<h4>Leeding by example</h4>

I try to offer a good example to the other members, because we are in the same team after all.

I do not miss any meetings and also try to announce changes in a useful manner for all involved.

From time to time, I assign myself some technical challenging tickets from inside the Sprint, even though most of the time, as manager I would spend only 30% or 10% of the time coding.

<h4>Motivating people</h4>

I talk to each teammember, to find out their inner motivation.

After that, I will present:

- what is our team goal
- what we have to do to achieve it
- how will we do this
- what is their role in this

If there is a personal issues involved, I try to understand if I can help in any way there.

<h4>Tough decision</h4>

One tough decision I had to take as a fresh people manager was to go remote with the whole team and onboard new remote members also.

<h4>Weakness</h4>

As a leader, you may find yourself rushing to solve the issue yourself, rather than try to present the problem to a responsible member.

This should not happen on the long term, you should be able to delegate work, as this will be helping members learn from their mistakes.

<h4>Delegating work</h4>

Each team has 4 levels of commitment across members:

- low skills, low motivation (juniors)
- low skils, high motivation (juniors/mids)
- high skills, low motivation (mids)
- high skills, high motivation (seniors)

You need to know when to:

- be directive (they will ask you how to start implementation)
- offer guidance (they will try do to it themselves, mentioning they did this before)
- encourage (they will ask you to check their solution)
- delegate (they will come back with the solution ready)

Involving the whole team in the implementation, testing, releasing process and monitoring surely creates a responsible and independent team.
