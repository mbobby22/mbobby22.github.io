excerpt: "Distributed computing is the method of making multiple computers work together to solve tasks and making it feel like a single computer is used."
---

Such a system joins and uses together several components from different devices, located at different geographical locations.

They are connected over a network and communicate by passing messages to each other.

<h4>Nodes</h4>

They are organised in nodes which could represent computer systems, resources or processes.

The entire system functions as a single unit, to process tasks or share resources.

<h4>Types</h4>

- peer-to-peer
- client-server
- 3-tier or n-tier

<h4>Properties</h4>

- Fault tolerance
- Scalability: the ability to easily add or remove nodes
- Resource sharing (such as a printer)
- Transparency: appear like a single unit is used for processing

<h4>Downsides</h4>

- Response time
- Security
- Network setup costs (which may be very high)

Sample usage: databases, file systems, messaging systems.

<h2>Distributed computing</h2>

Distributed computing makes usage of distributed systems to complete particular computing tasks.

Parts of a progrem get executed in different computing systems from the network.

This increases the computin power and more complex tasks can be executed.

Usage is cheaper than a centralized system and the processing capabilities are larger.

**Challenge** here is partitioning computational tasks into different parts, to be executed on different computers in parallel.

**Algorithm** setup would output how to execute the program on different available nodes.

Sample case: mobile systems, social media networks, weather monitoring systems, eCommerce systems.
