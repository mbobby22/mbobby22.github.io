Welcome to my [coding blog][coding-blog-link]! I'm Bogdan, and I'm excited to share insights and solutions from my **15 years** of **Software Engineering**, primarily focused on `PHP`. 

Here, you'll find practical tips and tricks for overcoming challenges in the coding world.

Since 2022, I've expanded my expertise to include `Kotlin` and `Golang`, and I often reflect on some humorous moments in programming, like this funny tweet I came across:

Feel free to reach out via [email][coding-blog-email] for questions, **quotes**, or just to **share** your thoughts.

Happy coding!
